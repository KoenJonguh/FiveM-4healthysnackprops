4 Healthy snack props for your FiveM server to add that little detail when eating.
Includes an apple, banana, orange and a carrot. Yes, a carrot.

Just drag and drop the folder 'knjgh_4healthysnackprops' into your resources and make sure to add it to your server config.
If you are streaming more props and maybe also my pizzaslices props (https://github.com/KoenJonguh/5-pizza-slices-props-fivem), then its better to just combine all props into one resource. Just make sure to load my ytyp's to your fxmanifest -> data_file 'DLC_ITYP_REQUEST' 'stream/knjgh_fruits.ytyp'

I DID NOT CREATE THESE MODELS.
Normally i create them myself, but i mean they're fruits. Somebody must have made fruits before, so why spend hours while i could use these bad boys from these cool people on Sketchfab? I only decreased the polygons, lowered texture resolutions, added collision and thats it.
